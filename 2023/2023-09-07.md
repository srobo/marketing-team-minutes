## Action Points

## Space Theme Proposal

The teams are working to gather resources from a nearby asteroid belt. They must return the asteroids to their home planet or their space station for to expand their civilisation. Their space station is under construction so extra points for delivering to there. Lurking within the asteroid field lies an unassuming egg that looks very similar to an asteroid. If disturbed this egg will hatch wreaking havoc all around it, it would be bad if this egg ended on a planet or space station...

Potential names:

- Starship Scavenge
- Final Frontier

## Jungle Theme Proposal

The teams are on an expedition to find rare and ancient artifacts within the deep jungle. Returning the artifacts to their base camp, or the safety of their Jungle Truck, will ensure their expedition is a success. Rumors have it that in the darkest depths of the jungle, there lies an object of pure evil. Great misfortune shall befall any person that is unlucky enough to lay claim to this cursed artifact, it should be avoided at all costs...

Potential names:

- Relic Raiders
- Secrets of the Jungle
