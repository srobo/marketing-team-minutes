    - Lets plan in doing
- Onboarding new volunteers
    - We sent out invites to some scheduled calls
    - Email was a little passive, only 1 person come back so far
    - Could be that they just want to help at events which is fine

    - TikToks
        - Viv might be able to self plagarise a TikTok of setup
- Team Supervisor Pack / Welcome
    - A pack of resources to give to Team Supervisors to help explain what SR is
    - Also help to recruit teams
    - We could send physical copy + stickers to teams once they signed up
    - Would that not be useful for teams as they may have already got a team if they signed up
    - If we improve the Compete page that could handle rookie teams
    - We think this should be a welcome pack sent to supervisors once their place is confirmed
