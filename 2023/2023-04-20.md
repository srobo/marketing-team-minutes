        - \+ photos

    - Photo link added by Sam
    - Should we try and get this printed in a newspaper?
        - May have tried in 2019
        - Let's give it a go
        - Are people going to want to post about something a month ago?
            - Probably not
        - Let's think about this in advance for next year
- Onboarding new volunteers
    - Potential for HR team to be made but a way off yet
    - We should onboard as normal
    - We have the start of a new presentation
        - We need to finish this
    - When we reach out should we ask what areas they want to get involved with
        - Does this get us much over just asking them in a call?
        - Could help us group intro calls
        - We had signups from competition volunteers and competitors. We could treat these groups differently
        - Not sure if we'd get much benefit from splitting these groups out
    - We should check that buddies know what is expected of them
        - Reaching out regurlaly
        - Helping to find them tasks
            - What if no tasks?
            - e.g. Many people may want to do hardware but we're not doing anything right now
    - We could plan a certain number of intro calls and let them pick one to join
    - After intro talk we should set up a meeting 1 on 1 (ideally) with their buddy so they can chat and figure out how to get stuck in
- Plan for Videos
    - SR2023: Summary
        - Show off the event about a minute max.
        - We have interviews but people's faces aren't that interesting
            - We could splice audio over livestream footage of their robot
            - Need to clean up audio of interviews
    - For future events we should plan the videos prior to gathering the footage
        - Can figure out a shot list for each video and easier to piece together?
    - TikToks
        - Could use parts of footage for TikToks
- Social
    - We should plan a social
    - Some external factors (uni exams, kit collation etc.) mean we should probably hold off until July
